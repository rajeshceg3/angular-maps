# Angular Google Maps & 3D Integration Demo

This project demonstrates how to integrate Google Maps and 3D graphics (using Three.js) within an Angular application. It serves as a starter template and a learning resource for developers looking to combine mapping functionalities with interactive 3D elements.

## Features

*   **Google Maps Integration:** Displays an interactive Google Map using the `@agm/core` library.
*   **Basic 3D Rendering:** Includes a simple example of rendering 3D graphics using Three.js, potentially overlaid or interacting with the map. (This will need to be verified by inspecting `gmap.component.ts` or `map.component.ts` if they contain 3D logic).
*   **Angular Structure:** Built with Angular, showcasing component-based architecture and modern JavaScript practices.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed. We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm or yarn:** npm (Node Package Manager) comes with Node.js. Alternatively, you can use yarn.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you prefer yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
    This command will download all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`.

3.  **Google Maps API Key (Important):**
    This project uses Google Maps. You will need to obtain a Google Maps JavaScript API key and enable the necessary APIs (Maps JavaScript API).
    *   Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    *   Create a new project or select an existing one.
    *   Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" and create a new API key.
    *   Make sure to restrict your API key to prevent unauthorized use (e.g., by HTTP referrers or IP addresses).
    *   Enable the "Maps JavaScript API" for your project in the "Library" section of "APIs & Services".
    *   Once you have your key, you'll need to add it to the project. The typical place for this in an `@agm/core` setup is in your `AppModule` ( `src/app/app.module.ts`) when importing `AgmCoreModule.forRoot({...})`.
        Example (in `src/app/app.module.ts`):
        ```typescript
        import { AgmCoreModule } from '@agm/core';

        @NgModule({
          imports: [
            // ... other imports
            AgmCoreModule.forRoot({
              apiKey: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY' // <--- REPLACE THIS
            })
          ],
          // ...
        })
        export class AppModule { }
        ```
    *   **Note:** For security, never commit your API key directly to your repository if it's public. Consider using environment variables or a configuration file that's excluded from version control (e.g., via `.gitignore`). For this demo, we'll proceed with the direct addition, but be mindful of this for real applications.

## Development Server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build: `npm run build -- --configuration production`.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). This will typically open a browser window to display test results. For CI environments, tests are often run headlessly (see CI/CD section).

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. (Note: `package.json` lists `ng e2e` but doesn't specify a framework like Protractor or Cypress. This section might need adjustment based on actual e2e setup if any).

## Linting

Run `npm run lint` to lint the codebase using ESLint (as per typical Angular setups). This helps maintain code quality and consistency.

## Further Help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

(This README assumes the project uses `@agm/core` for Google Maps and potentially Three.js. If the actual map/3D components (`gmap.component.ts`, `map.component.ts`) reveal different libraries or approaches, this README might need minor adjustments.)
