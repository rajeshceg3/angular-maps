# Product Requirements Document: Angular Google Maps & 3D Integration Demo

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the "Angular Google Maps & 3D Integration Demo" project. The primary purpose of this project is to serve as a technical demonstration and a starter kit for developers interested in combining interactive maps with 3D graphics within an Angular framework.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** Provide a clear, functional example of integrating Google Maps and basic Three.js 3D rendering in an Angular application.
*   **Educational Objective:** Help developers understand the setup, configuration, and basic usage patterns for `@agm/core` (Google Maps) and `three` (Three.js) in an Angular context.
*   **Boilerplate/Starter:** Offer a foundational codebase that developers can extend for their own projects requiring map and 3D functionalities.
*   **Demonstrate Best Practices:** Showcase a clean project structure, adherence to Angular conventions, and basic CI/CD setup.

## 3. Target Users

*   **Angular Developers:** Developers with existing Angular knowledge looking to incorporate mapping or 3D features into their applications.
*   **Students & Learners:** Individuals learning about web mapping, 3D graphics in the browser, or advanced Angular features.
*   **Prototypers:** Developers needing a quick way to prototype ideas involving maps and 3D elements.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### FR1: Map Display
*   **FR1.1:** The application shall display a Google Map on the main view.
*   **FR1.2:** The map shall be interactive, allowing users to pan and zoom.
*   **FR1.3:** The map shall initialize with a default center location and zoom level. (e.g., a well-known city or a global view).
*   **FR1.4 (Potential):** Display markers on the map at specified locations (if `gmap.component.ts` or similar shows this).

### FR2: 3D Element Display (Basic)
*   **FR2.1:** The application shall render a simple 3D object using Three.js.
*   **FR2.2 (Potential):** The 3D object/scene should be rendered in a designated area, possibly overlaid or adjacent to the map. (Actual implementation to be confirmed by inspecting `map.component.ts` or `gmap.component.ts`).
*   **FR2.3 (Potential):** Basic interaction with the 3D scene (e.g., camera rotation if implemented).

### FR3: Project Setup & Configuration
*   **FR3.1:** The project shall provide clear instructions (in README.md) for setting up the development environment.
*   **FR3.2:** The project shall include instructions for installing dependencies.
*   **FR3.3:** The project shall guide users on how to configure necessary API keys (e.g., Google Maps API Key).

### FR4: Build and Test Utilities
*   **FR4.1:** The project shall be buildable into static assets for deployment using a standard Angular CLI command (`npm run build`).
*   **FR4.2:** The project shall include unit tests for core components/services (initial setup provided by Angular CLI).
*   **FR4.3:** The project shall support code linting (`npm run lint`).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Usability
*   **NFR1.1:** The demonstration should be easy to understand and run.
*   **NFR1.2:** Code should be well-commented, especially in areas specific to map and 3D integration.

### NFR2: Performance
*   **NFR2.1:** The application should load within a reasonable timeframe on a modern browser with a decent internet connection.
*   **NFR2.2:** Map interactions (pan, zoom) should be smooth.
*   **NFR2.3:** Basic 3D rendering should not cause significant performance degradation for simple scenes.

### NFR3: Maintainability
*   **NFR3.1:** The codebase should follow Angular best practices and conventions.
*   **NFR3.2:** The project structure should be logical and easy to navigate.

### NFR4: Extensibility
*   **NFR4.1:** The project should be structured in a way that allows developers to easily add new features or modify existing ones.

## 6. Future Considerations / Potential Enhancements (Out of Scope for Initial Version)

*   More complex 3D scenes and interactions.
*   Synchronization between map events and 3D scene changes (e.g., placing 3D objects at specific geographic coordinates).
*   User interface controls for manipulating map and 3D views.
*   Advanced Google Maps features (e.g., custom markers, drawing tools, directions).
*   Deployment scripts for common hosting platforms.
*   More comprehensive test coverage, including e2e tests for user flows.

## 7. Assumptions

*   Users have a basic understanding of Angular.
*   Users are capable of obtaining and configuring a Google Maps API key.
*   The primary focus is on the integration demonstration, not on building a feature-complete, production-ready application.

(This PRD is based on the initial understanding of the project. It will be refined if the code scan in the next steps reveals significantly different existing functionalities.)
